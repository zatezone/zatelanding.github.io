		<blockquote><p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 1.05em" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Julliana Katherine M. 
		Zate and I was born on June 24, 2003 in Manila.<sup>1</sup> I am now 19 years old and currently live in Mandaluyong City.<sup>2</sup> I lived in Paranaque 
		City before with my father's parents.<sup>3</sup> My mother was a student when she got pregnant and my father had stopped studying at that time.<sup>4</sup> 
		As a result, they lived with my grandparents while they didn't have enough money to pay for their own apartment.<sup>5</sup> I am their first child and my 
		grandparents' first grandchild.<sup>6</sup> My grandmother's mother was a kind-hearted woman who lived a simple life and she thought I was mute when I was 
		young.<sup>7</sup> However, as I grew up, I opened up and became more talkative.<sup>8</sup> I also lived with my uncle and auntie when I was a kid and they 
		would often take me on vacationsto their house.<sup>9</sup> I have a close relationship with my family now and always have.<sup>10</sup><br><br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years after I was born, my parents decided to expand our family and had a second child, a beautiful baby girl.<sup>11</sup> 
		During the early years of our childhood, we lived with our grandparents who took care of us and provided us with love and comfort.<sup>12</sup> Our 
		grandparents' home was filled with laughter, warmth, and fond memories, and it was there that I formed a close bond with my sister.<sup>13</sup> As we grew 
		up, our parents decided that it was time for us to have our own space and rented an apartment in Mandaluyong City.<sup>14</sup> The move was filled with 
		mixed emotions as I was leaving behind the only home I had ever known, but I adapted quickly and made new memories with my family in our new apartment.
		<sup>15</sup><br><br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years have passed since then and I still miss the times when I lived with my grandparents, but I am grateful for the love and 
		care they provided during my childhood.<sup>16</sup> The memories of our childhood spent with them will always hold a special place in my heart.<sup>17</sup> 
		I went to Eulogio Rodriguez Elementary School for my elementary education.<sup>18</sup> The school was conveniently located just beside our house.
		<sup>19</sup> I will always cherish the memories of my childhood and am thankful for the love and support of my family throughout my life.<sup>20</sup>

		<blockquote><p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 1.05em" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years later, I turned into a 
		teenager.<sup>1</sup> I spent being teenager in Mandaluyong City.<sup>2</sup> I met many people, they became my friends.<sup>3</sup> I had the privilege of 
		studying high school at Rizal Technological University, a prestigious educational institution known for its quality education and facilities.<sup>4</sup> 
		Although the school was somewhat far from my home, I was eager to attend it and gain new experiences.<sup>5</sup> As a teenager, I was more independent and 
		capable of traveling the distance to school on my own.<sup>6</sup> The thought of being able to further my education and reach my goals motivated me to push 
		through any challenges that came my way.<sup>7</sup> The campus was sprawling, and I was impressed by the state-of-the-art facilities and resources available 
		to students.<sup>8</sup> Despite the distance, I quickly adapted to my new environment and made new friends who shared my passion for learning.<sup>9</sup> 
		I am grateful for the opportunity to attend Rizal Technological University.<sup>10</sup> I will always cherish the memories I made there.<sup>11</sup>
		<br><br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discovered new talent when I was in my teenager days.<sup>12</sup> I have always been passionate about music, and among all 
		the instruments, the guitar always fascinated me the most.<sup>13</sup> So, I took it upon myself to learn how to play it and started practicing regularly.
		<sup>14</sup> After months of hard work and dedication, I finally felt confident enough to showcase my skills in front of an audience.<sup>15</sup> The 
		opportunity presented itself when my school organized a cultural program, and I decided to give it a shot.<sup>16</sup> Despite being a shy person, I 
		mustered up the courage to perform on stage and played my heart out.<sup>17</sup> The audience was left spellbound, and I received a lot of applause.
		<sup>18</sup> It took me so many years to overcome my fear of performing in front of people, but I am glad I finally did.<sup>19</sup> Sharing my talent 
		with my school was a proud moment for me, and I am grateful for the opportunity.<sup>20</sup> </p></blockquote>
