      <h3> SKILLS </h3>
      <blockquote><p> I will now discuss my skills. I may not consider myself a highly skilled person, but I have developed two talents over the years. It is playing 
	  the guitar and drawing. I believe I learned these skills when I was around 7 years old.  Although I can't recall the exact time. However, I have improved my 
	  guitar playing skills since then. I still enjoy playing it when I am bored, even now. In my younger years, I also utilized my free time to hone my drawing 
	  skills. I did not have a phone to occupy my time. This dedication to honing my skills has allowed me to develop a deeper appreciation for both guitar playing 
	  and drawing. I often find myself drawn to these activities when I need to unwind. One of the things I enjoy most about playing the guitar is the sense of 
	  accomplishment I feel whenever I perform a song flawlessly. I have also found that playing the guitar is a great way to express myself. I use it as a creative 
	  outlet when I am feeling overwhelmed or stressed. My love for drawing also stems from my desire to create and express myself. Although I must admit that I am 
	  not capable of drawing from imagination or without referring to examples on the internet. Overall, playing the guitar and drawing are important aspects of my 
	  life. It helped me to develop skills that I will always cherish. Even though I may not be an expert in either area, I will continue to practice and improve. 
	  Because these activities bring me a great deal of joy and satisfaction. </p></blockquote>
      
      <h3> HOBBIES </h3>
      <blockquote><p> Playing guitar and drawing were my passions as a child. Over the years they have become valuable skills that I am proud of. When I have free 
	  time, I find myself drawn to my guitar. I can express myself through music and create beautiful melodies. I also enjoy playing games. It provides a fun and 
	  engaging way to pass the time. Although I used to be an avid drawer, I don't find myself doing it as often anymore. However, I still cherish the memories and 
	  skills I gained from that experience. In recent years, I have taken up a new hobby, which is browsing the internet. I enjoy watching videos on popular 
	  platforms like YouTube and TikTok. This is a great way for me to stay entertained, and it helps me relax and unwind after a long day. Another hobby that I 
	  enjoy is playing billiards. Whenever I visit my aunt's house, I always look forward to playing a game or two on their table. It's a fun and engaging activity 
	  that requires skill and strategy, and it's always a blast to play with family and friends. Lastly, I used to play chess with my grandfather, who was an 
	  excellent player. We spent hours playing together, and I learned so much from him about strategy, patience, and mental agility. Unfortunately, we no longer 
	  live in the same house, so we don't have the opportunity to play as often as we used to. However, I will always cherish those memories and the lessons I 
	  learned from playing chess with my grandfather. </p></blockquote>
        
      <h3> INTEREST </h3>
      <blockquote><p> My interest in shoes has developed into a passion over the years. From my teenage years, when I first discovered my interest in shoes and 
	  streetwear. To my college years, where I turned that interest into a business by reselling shoes. Browsing shoes on the internet has become a hobby for me. 
	  I constantly seek out new information about the latest trends and releases in the world of footwear. I have also explored other interests along the way. For 
	  example, I have always been curious about learning a new musical instrument, such as the drums. However, with my busy schedule, I have not had the opportunity 
	  to pursue this interest just yet. Nevertheless, I hope that one day I find the time to learn this new skill and expand my musical abilities. In conclusion, my 
	  interest in shoes continues to be a major part of my life, but I am always open to exploring new interests and hobbies. Whether it is through my business, my 
	  hobbies, or my personal pursuits, I am constantly looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and skills. </p></blockquote>
